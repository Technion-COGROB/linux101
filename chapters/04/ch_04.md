# Chapter 4: File Permissions and Ownership

(content partialy taken from course 095219/07_linux_tools)

The concept of file in *nix is very strong. It proves it by living without change for 50 years.
 Anything that implements *{open, close, read, write, seek}* can be a file.<br>
A file can be simply a storage: keep a text document, a picture, executable program, source code...

Linux exposes hardware and OS details using ‚Äúfiles‚Äù that do not represent actual storage.

example: `/dev   /proc   /sys`

Go ahead and try 
```
cat /proc/cpuinfo     
cat /cpu/meminfo
```

# File permissions

A file has permissions: who can do what.<br>
A **Directory (now referring to storage!) is also a file!**

This means that by using file permissions, we can recursively give access to directory to a specific user/group.

Linux file permissions are a crucial aspect of the operating system, governing how users and processes can access and modify files. They establish a security layer, ensuring only authorized entities can interact with data. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:

## Understanding the Actors
**User:** Refers to an individual with an account on the system. 

**Group:** A collection of users who share certain permissions. 

**Others:** All users who are not the owner or part of the group associated with the file. 


In the old days, file permissions were ONLY by user/group/other.
With today‚Äôs challenges, there are sometimes variations ‚Äì adding more security features.
See Appendix A for more on File Systems

## The Permission Trio
Each file and directory in Linux have three permission sets:
* **Read (r):** Allows users to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory. 

* **Write (w):** Enables users to modify the contents of a file or create/delete files within a directory (requires write permission on the directory itself). 

* **Execute (x):** Grants users the ability to execute a file if it's a program (executable file). For directories, the execute permission allows users to access the directory contents (listing files). 


## Visualizing Permissions:
File permissions are typically represented using an octal (base-8) number, where each digit corresponds to a permission set for the owner, group, and others (in that order). Each digit is further broken down as a combination of the read (r = 4), write (w = 2), and execute (x = 1) permissions:

* If a permission is present, its corresponding value is added. 
 * If a permission is absent, its value is 0. 
For example, a permission of 751 translates to:
* **Owner:** Read (4), Write (2), and Execute (1) permissions (full access). 
* **Group:** Read (4) and Execute (1) permissions. 
* **Others:** Execute (1) permission only. 

## Common Permission Examples:
* **644:** Read and write for owner, read for group and others (common for user files). 
* **755:** Read, write, and execute for owner, read and execute for group and others (common for executable programs). 
 * **700:** Read, write, and execute only for the owner (highly restrictive). 

## Changing Permissions
The `chmod` command allows you to modify file permissions. For instance, to grant everyone (i.e. `other`) read permission for a file named "data.txt", you would use:
 `chmod o+r data.txt`

and see the `ls -l` output:
<div style="white-space: pre; font-family: monospace; overflow-x: auto;">
-rwxr-xr-- 1 cnoam  cdrom 1234 Jan  2 00:00 file.txt
    ‚¨ÜÔ∏è         ‚¨ÜÔ∏è    ‚¨ÜÔ∏è   ‚¨ÜÔ∏è      ‚¨ÜÔ∏è         ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 
Permissions   User   group Size    Date       name
</div>
<small>note: we ignore the "1" before the name</small>
<br><br>

The first column `(-rwxr-xr--)` represents the permissions:<br>
* `-` : File type (- for a regular file, d for a directory)
* `rwx`: Permissions for the owner.
* `r-x`: Permissions for the group.
* `r--`: Permissions for others

You can also use symbolic Mode: `chmod [who][operation][permission] file `
* who: u (user/owner), g (group), o (others), a (all).
*  operation: + (add), - (remove), = (set exact).

Examples:<br>
```shell
chmod u+x file.txt       # Add execute permission for the owner
chmod g-w file.txt       # Remove write permission for the group
chmod o=r file.txt       # Set read-only permission for others
chmod a+rw file.txt      # Add read and write permissions for all
```

Numeric Mode: <br>
* Permissions are represented by a three-digit octal number.
* Each digit ranges from 0 to 7 and represents a combination of read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions.
``` shell
chmod 755 file.txt       # Set permissions to rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file.txt       # Set permissions to rw-r--r--
chmod 700 file.txt       # Set permissions to rwx------
chmod 666 file.txt       # Set permissions to rw-rw-rw-
```

### üíª Excercise --- change file permissions


1. Create a file named example.txt.
1. View the permissions of `example.txt`.
1. Add execute permission for the owner of example.txt.
1. Verify the permissions.
1. Remove write permission for the group.
1. Set permissions to `rwxr-xr--` for example.txt using a single command
1. Verify the permissions.

### üíª Excercise --- create executable file


1. Create a file called script.sh
2. Add `echo ‚Äòhello world‚Äô` to the script (so it will print hello world)
3. Try to run the script `./script.sh` . It should fail running.
4. Fix it and run it.


# Understanding File Ownership
* Each file has an owner (user) and a group associated with it. 
* The owner can change the permissions for the file using chmod. 
* The system administrator (root) has special privileges and can modify permissions for any file. 

## Impact on Security
Proper file permissions are essential for system security. They prevent unauthorized users from accessing or modifying sensitive data. 

In summary, Linux file permissions offer a granular control system, ensuring data is protected while allowing authorized users the necessary access levels. 

## Example:<br>
The regular user can enter the directory, view a file, but not create a new file or delete it.

As user `root` I typed 
```shell
mkdir test
touch test/fileA
```

``` shell
$ ls -ld test 
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 18 13:36 test 
$ cd test 
$ ls 
fileA 
$ touch newfile 
touch: cannot touch 'newfile': Permission denied 
$ cat fileA 
$ rm fileA 
rm: remove write-protected regular empty file 'fileA'? y 
rm: cannot remove 'fileA': Permission denied 
$ 
$ sudo chmod a-x test 
$ ls -ld test 
drw-r--r-- 2 root root 4096 Mar 18 13:36 test 
$ cd test 
bash: cd: test: Permission denied
```

# Check yourself
1. Create directory named `parent` with these permissions `drwx---r-x root root .` <br>
**Hint**: To set ownership, run `sudo chown root:root parent`
1. Create a sub directory `child` with permissions `0777`<br>
Can you list the files in child? <br>
Can you modify a file in child? <br>
Delete a file? Create a file? <br>
Confused?<br>

1. Try the same with a file in `parent`

## BUT WHY?
For a directory:<br>
`x` means you can traverse the directory (access files if you know their name).

`w` means you can write to the directory ‚Äì adding or deleting files. 
So you might be able to edit an existing file, but you not delete it!

## Summary
You can have **read/write** access to a sub directory, while being **limited in the parent**

### Know these commands
`chmod`: change file permissions <br>
`chown`: change file ownership. It can be used recursively. By default, the command is NOT recursive


# File Dates
Each file has three timestamps

1. Access Time (`atime`): last time the file was accessed. Updating this field can be turned off to improve performance.
2. Modification Time (`mtime`):
Represents the last time the file's content was actually modified

3. Change Time (`ctime`):
Records the last time the file's metadata (excluding content) was changed. This could include modifications to file permissions, ownership, or group association.

Note that file creation time is not always available (it is not required by the POSIX standard)

Fun fact: In Windows, even in the 21st century, the modification time of a file can be before the creation time. 

## Directory timestamps
A directory is also a file, so it has these timestamps.

`atime` (Access Time)
* Updated when the directory is read (e.g., when listing its contents with ls or traversing it).
* Some systems optimize it away unless explicitly enabled (e.g., using relatime).

`mtime` (Modification Time)
* Updated when the contents of the directory change ‚Äî i.e., when files are added, removed, or renamed inside the directory.

`ctime` (Change Time)
* Updated when the directory's **metadata** changes ‚Äî including changes to ownership, permissions, or when `mtime` itself changes.



**Example**<br>
List file from old to new modification time in long format:

`ls ‚Äìlrt # long format, reverse order, sort by modification time`

# Summary

Linux treats everything as a file ‚Äî even hardware and system interfaces (e.g., `/dev`, `/proc`). These may not represent actual storage but can be read like regular files.

## File Permissions

Files and directories have **permissions**:
- **Read (r)**: view file content or list directory
- **Write (w)**: modify file or create/delete in directory
- **Execute (x)**: run file or access directory contents

Permissions apply to:
- **Owner (user)**
- **Group**
- **Others**


## File Ownership

Each file has:
- An **owner (user)**
- An associated **group**

Only the owner or `root` can change permissions or ownership.

## File Timestamps

All files and directories have:
- **`atime`** ‚Äì Last accessed time
- **`mtime`** ‚Äì Last content modification time
- **`ctime`** ‚Äì Last metadata change time (e.g., permissions)

These timestamps help track activity and control security.

Linux permissions provide fine-grained access control and are critical for maintaining system security.
