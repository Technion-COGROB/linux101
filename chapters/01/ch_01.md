# Chapter 01 - Introduction to linux and WSL

In this chapter we will:

- see what is an operating system (OS)
- the history of linux
- How linux starts running (from power-on to running)



## Using a virtual machine (don't skip it!)
During the course, we will run and sometime break things. To run easily, we use a magical invention: A virtual computer (which is actually just a program running in your real computer) that runs the linux OS.
This allows for running linux inside Windows, and when breaking things, we can go back to a safe state.
Read [this](./virtual_machines.md) and come back here.


# From power-on to running linux

## Prerequisite: "Installing linux alpine in VM" lesson

Watch the [ðŸŽ¥ video](https://panoptotech.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=141815e4-0c6f-4176-b022-b2b000826174) in Panopto (accessible only to Technion accounts) and try to replicate it with your VirtualBox virtual computer.

Let's look at this flow:

## To summarize:
1. The hardware starts running code in the [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS).
2. The BIOS program looks for hardware. This can change from boot (i.e. power on) to the next boot.
3. User gets an option to choose where to boot from. This means that there may be a few storage devices (e.g. hard drive and USB drive), and each can have a different operating system on it.
4. Most of the time this stage is hidden -- loading the program called "boot loader". [The whole boot process is a long chain of small programs running in a line.]
5. At last the linux starts running. First the *Kernel* is loaded. It starts many services (in the video, these are the lines with the green '*').
6. Once the kernel is ready, it starts the parent process of all linux *user* code. This process is called "init" sometime and always has process ID 1.
7. The *init* process runs what is it in it's configuration files. In our case, it opens a terminal, and ask to login. In other cases, it can run without user interface at all (your washing machine) or with Graphical UI (e.g. ubuntu desktop)

# Check yourself
1. Look at the prints during the boot of Alpine. Can some of the servies be removed (i.e. not started) if we use this instlation without internet. Just look for the names in the internet. No need to actualy modify the boot process.
2. **advanced!** : Find where alpine stores its kernel loading configuration, and try to remove parts. Your goal is to reduce the boot time to minimum.
  
  >>>> TIP: At some point, you will ruin the config file and the Alpine will get stuck during boot. Instead of trying to fix it (you don't have access to the files ðŸ˜„), Use the virtualBox [**snapshot**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/user/snapshots.html) feature before you start breaking the OS.



##  What is Linux?

**Definition and Origins**
  At first there where Unix OS, developed by large companies, and costing a lot of money. In 1991, Linus Torvalds started a small project: re-write Unix as a free software. Its initial purpose was as a free and open alternative to proprietary Unix.

  Linux OS is both the kernel and a set of user space programs. We will explain these terms later.

 
As Linux matured in the 1990s and 2000s, major distributions began to emerge, each with its own focus and community. *Debian* emphasized stability and open-source purity, serving as the base for many others. *Red Hat* targeted enterprise environments with professional support and tools. Later, *Ubuntu* built on Debian to create a more user-friendly experience, bringing Linux to desktops and simplifying server deployment. 

These distributions helped standardize Linux usage, grow its adoption, and shape the diverse ecosystem we see today.

- **Impact on Technology**
  - Influence on server infrastructure, cloud computing, and development environments.
  - linux is everywhere (excpept for your desktop ðŸ˜„): powering the internet, IoT devices, supercomputers, android phones.



## Linux vs. Windows: Key Differences

### Core Philosophy and Design
  - Linux: Open-source, community-driven, customizable.
  - Windows: Proprietary, commercial focus, user-friendly interface.

### User Interface and Experience
  - Graphical User Interface (GUI) differences: flexibility in Linux desktop environments vs. a more uniform Windows experience.
  There are dozens of linux variants (called "distributions" and in short "disto"). Anyone can create a new distro. This is both good and bad, since a customer has more choice, but it is confusing to have so many and a lot of development effort is duplicated.
  - Command-line interfaces: The Linux terminal is a powerful tool. It is (almost) the same across all distros, and more importantly, it almost does not change for decades. What worked in 2005 will work now. 
  In Windows CMD/PowerShell, you CAN perform some of the tasks, but the focus is on GUI. As you know, GUI changes every year, so instructions become obsolete very quickly.


### Software and Package Management

A package manager:

 - Downloads software from **trusted** sources (called repositories)
 - Installs it along with any **dependencies** it needs
 - Lets you **update** the software easily
 - Allows **safe uninstalling**



  - Linux distributions:
     Each distro has its own  package managers (APT, YUM, Pacman)
  - Windows:
   *  MSI installer - Any hacker can create an installer. Nobody checks it.
   *  MS Window Store is a package manager, but failed to gain traction. It improved in Win11, but still most developers do not offer their product there, and so users download from other sources.



### Customization
  
   Linux allows for modular configurations compared to Windowsâ€™ integrated ecosystem.
   In Linux, you can take what the distro developer packed, but you can also configure and fine tune which components to throw away, and what paramets to set (e.g. tuning network parameters)

   In Windows, An IT manager can tune some limited parts of the OS, but the configuration is more rigid.


### Use Cases and Industry Adoption**
  linux wins in  Servers, development environments, embedded systems
  Windows wins in desktop and enterprise use.

  **Cost and licensing models**: linux is free and community supported; Windows use commercial licensing and subscription models.

  PS: "linux is free" means you don't pay for the OS. But you may have to pay for consulting, IT personel etc. just as for Windows, and sometime even more.
  

# Finaly - What is WSL?

WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) is a feature in Windows that lets you run a full Linux environment directly inside Windows â€” no virtual machine setup, no dual-booting. 

WSL2 runs a real Linux kernel in a lightweight virtual machine (VM) using Microsoftâ€™s Hyper-V technology. This means better compatibility with Linux software, improved performance (especially for things like Docker), and support for more complex tasks.

WSL2 integrates tightly with Windows. You can access your Windows files from inside Linux (/mnt/c/Users/...), and you can even run Linux commands from the Windows command prompt or PowerShell (and vice versa).

For developers who need Linux but donâ€™t want to leave Windows â€” or who work across both ecosystems â€” WSL2 offers the best of both worlds. Itâ€™s fast, free, and doesnâ€™t require full-blown virtualization software like VirtualBox or VMware. That said, it's not a full desktop Linux â€” it runs headless, **command-line only** (though you can install a GUI if needed).
