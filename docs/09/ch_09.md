# Chapter 9: Package Management

This chapter introduces the basics of managing software on a Linux system using command-line tools. You'll learn how to install, update, and remove software, as well as how to search for packages and manage services.



## Installing, Updating, and Removing Software

### What is a package manager?
A package manager is a system tool that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages on a Linux system. It connects to online repositories to fetch software, ensures that all required dependencies are installed, and tracks which files belong to which package.

Without a package manager, users would need to manually download software, resolve complex dependency chains, and handle updates by themselves‚Äîmaking system maintenance error-prone and time-consuming.


### Limitations of Package Managers
Despite their power, package managers have limitations. They depend on curated repositories, so software not officially packaged or updated there can lag behind or be unavailable. Conflicts may arise when mixing packages from different sources, or when manually modifying system files.

Additionally, traditional package managers install system-wide software, making it difficult to manage per-user environments or multiple versions of the same tool‚Äîissues that newer tools like flatpak, snap, or language-specific managers (e.g., pip, npm) aim to address.

In Debian (and derived distros such as Ubuntu and its variants), `apt` is the formal package manager, but any distro can use its own (or develop a new one!)
 
 <br>

| Distribution | Package Manager | Format     | Example Command                  |
|--------------|------------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Debian/Ubuntu | `apt`, `dpkg`   | `.deb`     | `sudo apt install htop`         |
| Fedora/Red Hat | `dnf`, `rpm`   | `.rpm`     | `sudo dnf install htop`         |
| Arch Linux    | `pacman`        | `.pkg.tar.zst` | `sudo pacman -S htop`     |
| Alpine Linux  | `apk`           | `.apk`     | `apk add htop`                  |

##  Why Use `apt` Instead of `dpkg`?
(This applies to Debian/Ubuntu). <br>
While `dpkg` can install `.deb` files directly, it has important limitations. Consider these differences:

| Feature                      | `apt`                        | `dpkg`                  |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Resolves dependencies       | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚ùå No                   |
| Fetches packages from web   | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚ùå No                   |
| Can update all packages     | ‚úÖ Yes (`apt upgrade`)       | ‚ùå No                   |
| Maintains package database  | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚úÖ Yes (read-only)      |
| Safer for daily use         | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Expert use only      |

If it requires other packages, dpkg will not install them. You‚Äôll see errors like "dependency not satisfied".

Recommended Approach:<br>
Use `apt` whenever possible. It handles everything automatically and ensures your system remains in a consistent state.


### Example --- installing Google Chrome in Ubuntu
You want to install Chrome in you new Ubuntu machine. 

- You cannot install using the GUI "App Center" because Chrome is not there -- not an open source.
- Also, Some packages are are simply not available in the distro's repositories. Specifically, this one is not.
- Use the least preferred method:
    -  download the file from the site (Danger! Maybe this file is infected?)
    -  `sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb`

> Note: Some programs can be installed using `apt` or from the author's site (e.g. Docker). The version stored in the Ubuntu repos (where apt is taking the files) is too old, so Docker recommends uninstalling them, and use the fresh version from their site.


### Using `apt` ‚Äì Advanced Packaging Tool
- **Install a package**:
  `sudo apt install <package-name>`

- **Remove a package**:
   `sudo apt remove <package-name>`

- **Update the list of available packages**:
 `sudo apt update`

### üíª Exercise -- install "htop"
htop is a program to show the top processes running. It has nicer UI than `top`.

Install with `sudo apt install htop`

run: `htop`

Uninstall with `sudo apt remove htop`

This will (obviously!) work in Ubuntu system which uses apt.

How would you install it in Alpine?<br>
You guessed it: login as root, and `apk add htop`

# Summary

In summary, package managers are essential tools for maintaining a Linux system efficiently and safely.

They simplify software installation, automate dependency handling, and help keep systems consistent and up to date. While each Linux distribution has its own preferred tool - like `apt` on Ubuntu or `apk` on Alpine - the core ideas remain the same. 

Understanding both the power and the limitations of package managers prepares you to troubleshoot issues, choose appropriate tools, and safely extend your system with new software.
