### Preface
This short course should take you 8 to 12 hours of watching short videos, reading and mainly trying things on your computer.

This course is designed for students who use Microsoft Windows (or an Apple Mac) and have never used Linux before, specifically, the Linux Command Line.

At the end of this course, you will be able to connect to a Linux computer, and run basic commands on it. Most important: The FEAR will be gone!
