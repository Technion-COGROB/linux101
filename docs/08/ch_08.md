# Chapter 8: Users, Groups & Permissions


##  Objectives

- Understand how Linux identifies users and groups
- Learn where user/group info is stored
- Know how to view your identity and modify group memberships
- Apply permissions knowledge from earlier chapters to real-world user setups

---

##  User Accounts

Every process in Linux runs under a **user identity**. To check yours:

```bash
whoami
```

To see detailed information about yourself:

```bash
id
```

Example output:

```
uid=1000(noam) gid=1000(noam) groups=1000(noam),27(sudo)
```

- `uid` = User ID  
- `gid` = Primary group ID  
- `groups` = All groups this user belongs to

To change your own password:

```bash
passwd
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You may be prompted for your current password. Only works for your own account.

###  The Root User

The **root** user is the superuser in Linux, with **unrestricted access** to all files, commands, and system resources. This is the user to use for adminsistrative tasks such as installing programs.

- UID of root is always `0`.
- Can modify other users, install software, and override permission checks.

Use root powers sparingly. A common practice is to run privileged commands using `sudo`: (stands for "super-user do")

```bash
sudo some-command
```

Only users in the `sudo` group can do this.  This means that you may have an account on a computer *without* the ability to be root.



## Listing Users and Groups

All user information is stored in `/etc/passwd`:

‚ÑπÔ∏è Historically, (encrypted) passwords of users were stored in this file, hence the name.

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | less
```

Each line looks like:

```
noam:x:1000:1000:Noam Cohen,,,:/home/noam:/bin/bash
```

The fields are:

- Username
- Encrypted password placeholder
- User ID (UID)
- Group ID (GID)
- Description
- Home directory
- Login shell

To list all groups:

```bash
cat /etc/group | less
```

Each line looks like:

```
sudo:x:27:noam
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Try `man group`. 


## Adding/removing users
Obviously, only user root can do `adduser` and `deluser`


##  Managing Permissions (Recap)

File and directory access in Linux is based on:
- Owner
- Group
- Others

Use `ls -l` to view permissions:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 noam noam 1234 May 1  file.txt
```

From earlier chapters, recall:
- `chmod` ‚Äî change permission bits  
- `chown` ‚Äî change ownership  
- `chgrp` ‚Äî change group ownership



## üíª Exercise


### 1. Change Your Password

```bash
passwd
```

Try this now and note how many characters are accepted (even though they don't echo to the screen).


### 2. Create a New Group and Add a User

> You'll need `sudo` privileges.

```bash
sudo groupadd mygroup
sudo usermod -aG mygroup $USER
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è  The `$USER` is an environment variable holding the name of the current user. Using this variable allows for writing general scripts that will work for all users.

Then **log out and back in** for the group membership to take effect.

Check your group list:

```bash
groups
```

You should see `mygroup` listed.



### 3.  Test File Permissions by Group

```bash
mkdir shared-folder
sudo chgrp mygroup shared-folder
chmod g+rw shared-folder
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è the `sudo` is needed here since only group members may add files to a group (a safety measure), and you might not yet be in this group.

This lets all users in `mygroup` read/write the folder, without affecting the permissions of Owner and Other.
