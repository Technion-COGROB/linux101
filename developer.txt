To detect broken links in the MD files: "is there a tool that will recursively check each MD file for broken links"

I chose Rust lychee. 
```
# install via cargo
cargo install lychee

# check every .md in your tree
lychee  chapters
```
but cargo failed becuase it cannot find openssl lib 
you need to `sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config`

After build is finished:
```
cd linux_course
lychee chapters
```

MD readers behaved differently, so link resolving (for example) behaves differently on each.
Solution: create static site (html). There are a few options:mkdocs, hugo, zola, docusaurus.

Will try zola (single binary, no deps)  
```
flatpak install flathub org.getzola.zola
flatpak run org.getzola.zola <some command>
```

also installed mkdocs, forcing into the global system:

`pip install mkdocs --break-system-packages`
then `mkdocs serve` and watch the magic.

To create a static site (not as good looking as the served one): `mkdocks build`

# git pre-commit hook
always run the link checker before commit. 
Copy the pre-commit file to .git/hooks. Make it executable


# The web site
The site is hosted in github pages.
When pushing a commit to github, it automatically updated the website (recreating it from scratch).
