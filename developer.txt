To detect broken links in the MD files: "is there a tool that will recursively check each MD file for broken links"

I chose Rust lychee. 
```
# install via cargo
cargo install lychee

# check every .md in your tree
lychee --recursive chapters
```
but cargo failed becuase it cannot find openssl lib 
you need to `sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config`

After build is finished:
```
cd linux_course
lychee chapters
```
